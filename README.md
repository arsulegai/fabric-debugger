# Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode Debugger

This is for the test

A VS code extension and toolbox to debugging a chaincode.
The extension once installed can be used by developers of chaincode
to run and debug, understand how it behaves.

## Project Objectives

1. Develop a plugin that can be installed and run on any developer machine.
2. Ideally, one should be able to develop on any operating system, be it a
  Mac, Windows, or any of the Linux variant.
3. Debug the chaincode as the developers are used to writing their code.
4. Option to initialize the state database so that the debugging can be
  effective. -- Do not worry if you're new to Hyperledger Fabric.
5. Goal is for the chaincode to be deployment ready at the end.

## Futuristic Objectives

1. Come up with a package manager, so that the developers can export
  what they have as a chaincode package that can be deployed.
2. Define a secure and minimal container image that is safer for
  deployment engineers to pull in the binary and deploy it.

## Learning Goals

1. Understand what plugins mean.
2. Understand how VS code plugin development works.
3. Learn Hyperledger Fabric fundamentals.
4. Learn debugging skills.
5. It can get more and more tricky when you start reading the project objectives.

## Technology Stack

While this is pretty new territory, there could be more in future
to this list. At the least you will get exposure to the following

Containers and container orchestration engines, Hyperledger Fabric as a
blockchain protocol, smart contract development in Hyperledger Fabric,
VS code plugin development concepts, expertise in Java, Go and other
programming languages and much more.
